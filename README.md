# Overview
This is the 2nd project in Net Ninja/Shaun Pelling's Udemy course on D3 and it is a series of line graph visualisations which shows one for each different exercise for the purpose of tracking the amount of each exercise done in each day. If the user hovers over a given point in the graph, a point and dotted lines will appear so the user can read off a specific data point on each axis. 

This makes use of many of the same things used in the budget planner, however this includes features such as timescales, line paths, and data filtering.
